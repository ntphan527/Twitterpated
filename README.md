# Project 3 - *Twitterpated*

**Twitterpated** is a basic twitter app to read and compose tweets from the [Twitter API](https://apps.twitter.com/).

Time spent: **20** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] User can sign in using OAuth login flow.
- [x] User can view last 20 tweets from their home timeline.
- [x] The current signed in user will be persisted across restarts.
- [x] In the home timeline, user can view tweet with the user profile picture, username, tweet text, and timestamp.  In other words, design the custom cell with the proper Auto Layout settings.  You will also need to augment the model classes.
- [x] User can pull to refresh.
- [x] User can compose a new tweet by tapping on a compose button.
- [x] User can tap on a tweet to view it, with controls to retweet, favorite, and reply.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] When composing, you should have a countdown in the upper right for the tweet limit.
- [x] After creating a new tweet, a user should be able to view it in the timeline immediately without refetching the timeline from the network.
- [x] Retweeting and favoriting should increment the retweet and favorite count.
- [ ] User should be able to unretweet and decrement the retweet.
- [x] User should be able to unfavorite and should decrement the favorite count.
- [x] Replies should be prefixed with the username and the reply_id should be set when posting the tweet,
- [x] User can load more tweets once they reach the bottom of the feed using infinite loading similar to the actual Twitter client.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. How can you write reusable code? Are utility classes something we want to do?
2. When a single view controller has multiple segues, is there a better way to pass along data other than looking at storyboard IDs?

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
The Twitter API is a bit hard to navigate and understand the exact payload since its documentation is not uptodate. It's also hard when the error codes are not reflective of the actual problem. I also had to learn how to use Twitter since I am not a twitter user and had no idea what things like retweet mean!

# Project 4 - *Twitterpated*

Time spent: **18** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Hamburger menu
   - [x] Dragging anywhere in the view should reveal the menu.
   - [x] The menu should include links to your profile, the home timeline, and the mentions view.
   - [x] The menu can look similar to the example or feel free to take liberty with the UI.
- [x] Profile page
   - [x] Contains the user header view
   - [x] Contains a section with the users basic stats: # tweets, # following, # followers
- [x] Home Timeline
   - [x] Tapping on a user image should bring up that user's profile page

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Profile Page
   - [ ] Implement the paging view for the user description.
   - [ ] As the paging view moves, increase the opacity of the background screen. See the actual Twitter app for this effect
   - [ ] Pulling down the profile page should blur and resize the header image.
- [ ] Account switching
   - [ ] Long press on tab bar to bring up Account view with animation
   - [ ] Tap account to switch to
   - [ ] Include a plus button to Add an Account
   - [ ] Swipe to delete an account

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

  1. How did people implement the optionals relating to the profile header? It just seems a bit complicated and I don't know where to start.
  2.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I had a hard time try to implement the paging scrollview in the header of the profile view. Somehow the spacing is all messed up. That took a while and I couldn't figure it out. And also had to switch to getting the wireframes created for our group project so I didn't have much time left to continue with the optionals. I would love to see how other people implement the optional features.
